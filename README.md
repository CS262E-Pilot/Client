# Knight Rank
The Knight Rank application is a platform where Calvin students can connect with and compete against other students who have similar interests in competitive activities. By connecting students with shared interests, Knight Rank encourages growth in a competitive community. It allows students to improve their skills by challenging other students of similar or higher rank in any game or sport. Unlike other ranking systems, Knight Rank will be localized to Calvin, giving students the motivation to connect with others around them. Our product provides a fun and interesting way for students to compete and compare themselves with their peers.
